# Yoga Assistant - AI-Powered Yoga Pose Detection App

## üåü Inspiration

The Yoga Assistant app was born from a deep passion for making yoga accessible to everyone, regardless of their experience level. In today's fast-paced world, many people struggle to maintain consistent fitness routines, and yoga often feels intimidating to beginners. We wanted to create an app that not only guides users through yoga poses but also provides real-time feedback using cutting-edge AI technology.

The inspiration came from recognizing that:
- **Accessibility**: Many people can't afford personal yoga instructors
- **Consistency**: Users need motivation and tracking to build lasting habits
- **Technology Gap**: Existing apps lacked real-time pose feedback
- **Community**: People thrive when they can share progress and compete healthily
